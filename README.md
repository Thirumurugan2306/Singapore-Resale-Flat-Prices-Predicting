# Singapore HDB Resale Price Prediction

## Objective
The objective of this project is to predict resale prices of Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats in Singapore using machine learning. The project aims to provide a user-friendly web application for potential buyers and sellers, allowing them to estimate resale prices based on various input parameters.

## Tasks

### Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Task:** Collect a dataset of resale flat transactions from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) for the years 1990 to Till Date.
- **Details:** The dataset will be used to train the machine learning model. Perform data preprocessing to clean and structure the data for machine learning purposes.

### Feature Engineering
- **Task:** Extract relevant features from the dataset, including town, flat type, storey range, floor area, flat model, and lease commence date.
- **Details:** Additionally, create any additional features that may enhance prediction accuracy.

### Model Selection and Training
- **Task:** Choose an appropriate machine learning model for regression (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, or random forests).
- **Details:** Train the selected model on the historical data, using a portion of the dataset for training.

### Model Evaluation
- **Task:** Evaluate the model's predictive performance using regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R2 Score.

### Streamlit Web Application
- **Task:** Develop a user-friendly web application using Streamlit.
- **Details:** The application should allow users to input details of a flat (town, flat type, storey range, etc.) and utilize the trained machine learning model to predict the resale price based on user inputs.

### Deployment on Render
- **Task:** Deploy the Streamlit application on the Render platform or any other Cloud Platform.
- **Details:** Make the application accessible to users over the internet.

### Testing and Validation
- **Task:** Thoroughly test the deployed application to ensure it functions correctly and provides accurate predictions.
- **Details:** Validate the accuracy and reliability of the application's predictions.

## Deliverables
The project will deliver the following:
1. A well-trained machine learning model for resale price prediction.
2. A user-friendly web application (built with Streamlit/Flask/Django) deployed on the Render platform or any Cloud Platform.
3. Documentation and instructions for using the application.
4. A project report summarizing the data analysis, model development, and deployment process.

## Data Source
The dataset for this project is sourced from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) and covers resale flat transactions. The dataset can be accessed [here](https://beta.data.gov.sg/collections/189/view).

## Results
The project is expected to benefit both potential buyers and sellers in the Singapore housing market. Buyers can use the application to estimate resale prices and make informed decisions, while sellers can gain insights into their flat's potential market value. Additionally, the project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in real estate and web development.
